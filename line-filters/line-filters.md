# Line Filters

A _line filter_ is a common type of program that reads input on stdin, processes it, and then prints some derived result to stdout. `grep` and `sed` are common line filters.

Hereâ€™s an example line filter in Go that writes a capitalized version of all input text. You can use this pattern to write your own Go line filters.

Wrapping the unbuffered `os.Stdin` with a buffered scanner gives us a convenient `Scan` method that advances the scanner to the next token; which is the next line in the default scanner.

```go
scanner := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)
```

`Text` returns the current token, here the next line, from the input.

```go
for scanner.Scan() {
    ucl := strings.ToUpper(scanner.Text())
    fmt.Println(ucl) // Write out the uppercased line.
}
```

Check for errors during `Scan`. End of file is expected and not reported by `Scan` as an error.

```go
if err := scanner.Err(); err != nil {
    fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, "error:", err)
    os.Exit(1)
}
```

```sh
echo 'hello' > line-filters/data
echo 'filter' >> line-filters/data

cat line-filters/data | go run line-filters/main.go
# HELLO
# FILTER
```
