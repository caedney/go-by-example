# Non-Blocking Channel Operations

Basic sends and receives on channels are blocking. However, we can use `select` with a `default` clause to implement _non-blocking_ sends, receives, and even non-blocking multi-way `selects`.

Hereâ€™s a non-blocking receive. If a value is available on `messages` then `select` will take the `<-messages` case with that value. If not it will immediately take the `default` case.

```go
select {
case msg := <-messages:
    fmt.Println("received message", msg)
default:
    fmt.Println("no message received")
}
```

A non-blocking send works similarly. Here `msg` cannot be sent to the messages channel, because the channel has no buffer and there is no receiver. Therefore the `default` case is selected.

```go
msg := "hi"
select {
case messages <- msg:
    fmt.Println("sent message", msg)
default:
    fmt.Println("no message sent")
}
```

We can use multiple `cases` above the `default` clause to implement a multi-way non-blocking select. Here we attempt non-blocking receives on both `messages` and `signals`.

```go
select {
case msg := <-messages:
    fmt.Println("received message", msg)
case sig := <-signals:
    fmt.Println("received signal", sig)
default:
    fmt.Println("no activity")
}
```

```sh
go run non-blocking-channel-operations/main.go
# no message received
# no message sent
# no activity
```
